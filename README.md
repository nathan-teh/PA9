## Description
'Yo-Ho Jump!' is about a pirate duck, who is searching far across the Seven Seas for his long-lost parrot! Jump to the top of the tower to find him...or will you?

## Installation

All assets and libraries (including SFML) is included in this CMake project, so no further installation should be required.

## Instructions
Use the 'A' and 'D' keys to move your character left and right respectively and the spacebar to jump! Make your way up to the top strategically! But don't fall, or else you'll need to start over!

## Technologies
This game was written in C++, with some C libraries included. For the graphics portion, we incorporated SFML as the framework. With its introduction in class and from current TAs, we thought it was an ideal choice to utilize for graphical rendering.
